# Utilizing Personas in Product Development

Great question! User personas in a PRD serve as a critical design and decision-making tool throughout development. Here's how to effectively use them:

## 1. **Feature Prioritization**
Each feature should map to specific persona needs:
```
Feature: Real-time rescheduling
- Primary: Shop Floor Supervisor (handles disruptions)
- Secondary: Production Planner (monitors changes)
- Not relevant: System Administrator
→ This helps justify why this feature matters
```

## 2. **Design Decisions**
When making UI/UX choices, reference personas:
```
"Should we show solver statistics?"
- Operations Manager: YES - needs KPIs and metrics
- Shop Floor Supervisor: NO - needs simple go/no-go info
→ Solution: Progressive disclosure with role-based views
```

## 3. **Acceptance Criteria Validation**
Test each user story against the persona:
```
User Story: "As a Production Planner, I need to schedule multiple jobs on high-capacity machines"
✓ Does this solve their pain point? (manual scheduling is suboptimal)
✓ Does it align with their goals? (create optimal schedules)
✓ Is the solution appropriate for their technical level?
```

## 4. **Sprint Planning**
Prioritize based on persona impact:
```
Sprint 2 Focus: Production Planner features
- They're the primary users
- Their adoption drives system success
- Other personas depend on their output
```

## 5. **API Design**
Different personas need different interfaces:
```python
# Production Planner - High-level abstraction
POST /api/schedule/optimize
{
  "objective": "minimize_makespan",
  "constraints": ["standard_business_hours"]
}

# System Administrator - Full control
POST /api/solver/configure
{
  "search_strategy": "FIRST_FAIL",
  "time_limit": 300,
  "num_workers": 8
}
```

## 6. **Testing Scenarios**
Create test cases based on persona workflows:
```
Shop Floor Supervisor Scenario:
1. Machine breaks down at 10:15 AM
2. Supervisor marks machine unavailable
3. System reschedules affected tasks
4. Supervisor sees updated schedule in < 30 seconds
```

## 7. **Documentation Structure**
Organize docs by persona:
```
docs/
├── quick-start-planner.md      # For Production Planners
├── operations-guide.md         # For Shop Floor Supervisors
├── metrics-dashboard.md        # For Operations Managers
└── admin-configuration.md     # For System Administrators
```

## 8. **Success Metrics Alignment**
Track metrics that matter to each persona:
```
Production Planner Metrics:
- Time to create schedule: < 5 minutes
- Schedule quality score: > 85%

Shop Floor Supervisor Metrics:
- Rescheduling time: < 30 seconds
- Schedule adherence: > 90%
```

## Example: Using Personas in Code Reviews

```python
# Code Review Comment:
# "This error message is too technical for Shop Floor Supervisors"

# Bad:
raise ValueError("Constraint propagation failed: Integer domain [0,100] incompatible with cumulative demand")

# Good:
if user_role == "shop_floor_supervisor":
    raise SchedulingError("Cannot schedule task: Machine capacity exceeded. Try splitting the job or using a different machine.")
else:  # System admin gets full details
    raise SchedulingError("Constraint propagation failed: Integer domain [0,100] incompatible with cumulative demand")
```

## Persona-Driven Development Workflow

1. **Start of Sprint**: Review which personas are affected
2. **Feature Design**: Ask "How would [Persona] use this?"
3. **Implementation**: Consider persona's technical level
4. **Testing**: Create persona-based test scenarios
5. **Documentation**: Write for the target persona
6. **Demo**: Present using persona's perspective

The key is to constantly ask: **"Does this serve our personas' needs?"** rather than building features in isolation.
