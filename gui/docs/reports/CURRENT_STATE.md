### Implemented Constraints âœ…

#### Phase 1 Basic Constraints
1. **Task Duration Constraints**
   - Links start, duration, and end variables
   - Supports variable durations based on machine mode

2. **Precedence Constraints**
   - Ensures task dependencies are respected
   - Includes redundant constraints for performance

3. **Machine Assignment Constraints**
   - Exactly one machine mode per task
   - Duration depends on selected mode

4. **No-Overlap Constraints**
   - Prevents task conflicts on same machine
   - Uses interval variables for efficiency

5. **Setup Time Constraints** (NEW - Phase 1.2) âœ…
   - Sequence-dependent setup times between tasks
   - Conditional enforcement based on machine assignment
   - Configurable per task pair and machine
   - Full unit test coverage

### Solver Features âœ…
- **Objective**: Makespan minimization
- **Search Strategy**: CHOOSE_FIRST with SELECT_MIN_VALUE
- **Parallel Search**: 8 workers for faster solving
- **Time Limits**: Configurable solving time

## Current Project State

### Architecture Overview
- **Backend**: OR-Tools constraint programming solver (stable)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Supabase (complete)
- **Database**: Optimized Supabase schema (production-ready)
- **Integration**: GUI manages data that feeds into solver

### Git Status Summary
**Current Branch**: main  
**Recent Activity**: GUI development and security fixes
**Modified Files**: 
- GUI components (JobTemplateForm, SetupTimeForm, etc.)
- Database types and schema updates
- Package configurations

**Recent Commits**:
- f9aedca: Initial Next.js GUI implementation

- Security and production readiness improvements

## Future Development Roadmap

### Phase 2: Advanced Solver Features
- Machine capacity constraints (multiple simultaneous tasks)
- Machine availability windows (maintenance, shifts)
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### Phase 3: Enhanced GUI Features
- Real-time solver integration
- Schedule visualization and Gantt charts
- Advanced reporting and analytics

### Phase 4: Production Deployment
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Performance monitoring
- User authentication and authorization

## Usage Example

```python
from src.solver.core.solver import FreshSolver
from src.data.loaders.database import load_test_problem

# Load problem from database
problem = load_test_problem()

# Define setup times (optional)
setup_times = {
    ("task_1", "task_2", "machine_1"): 2,  # 30 minutes setup
    ("task_2", "task_3", "machine_1"): 1,  # 15 minutes setup
}

# Create and solve
solver = FreshSolver(problem, setup_times=setup_times)
solution = solver.solve(time_limit=60)

# Results include task schedules respecting all constraints
```

## Performance Targets
- **Small** (50 tasks): < 10 seconds âœ“
- **Medium** (500 tasks): < 60 seconds (pending verification)
- **Large** (5000 tasks): < 30 minutes (future target)
