# Active Development Context - 2025-07-31

## üéØ CURRENT FOCUS (Last Updated: 16:15)
**Primary Task**: GUI Console Error Detection & Fixing with Playwright
**Specific Issue**: Systematically identify and fix all console errors across GUI pages
**Immediate Goal**: Run comprehensive Playwright test to capture console errors, then fix them

## üîß ACTIVE FILES
- `gui/tests/comprehensive.spec.js` - Existing comprehensive test suite (372 lines)
- `gui/tests/fixtures/test-data.js` - Test data and navigation structure (248 lines)
- `gui/playwright.config.js` - Playwright configuration
- `gui/app/page.tsx` - Main GUI with navigation to all forms (237 lines)

## üö® KEY CONTEXT LOADED
- GUI has 12 form components across 5 navigation sections
- Existing Playwright setup with console error monitoring
- Test suite already captures console/network errors in testResults array
- Navigation structure: Organization, Templates, Resources, Scheduling, Jobs

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. Run existing comprehensive Playwright test to capture console errors
2. Analyze captured errors by severity and component
3. Fix identified console errors systematically
4. Re-run tests to verify fixes

## üîç CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION NOTES
**For Future Sessions**: Focus worklog on:
- Specific error types/components having issues
- Error patterns discovered (not full file contents)
- Fix strategies rather than full navigation details
- Key file paths without full file contents
