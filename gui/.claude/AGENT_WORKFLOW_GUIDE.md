# Agent-Integrated Constraint Development Guide

## 🤖 **Overview**

Your enhanced hook system now integrates seamlessly with your `@agent-⋌༼ •̀ ⌂ •́ ༽⋋ Ortools Model Expert` to provide expert OR-Tools constraint implementation combined with automated workflow management.

## 🚀 **Enhanced Workflow**

### **Traditional Workflow:**
```bash
1. Manually think through constraint requirements
2. Research OR-Tools best practices
3. Implement constraint function from scratch
4. Manually write comprehensive tests
5. Validate against STANDARDS.md manually
6. Debug integration issues
7. Optimize for performance
```

### **Agent-Integrated Workflow:**
```bash
1. `/add-constraint advanced_skill_matching`
   → System auto-detects Phase 2 complexity
   → Recommends @agent-⋌༼ •̀ ⌂ •́ ༽⋋ Ortools Model Expert
   → Generates context-rich agent prompt

2. Copy/paste agent command (provided by system)
   → Agent implements with OR-Tools expertise
   → Template-aware performance optimization
   → Full STANDARDS.md compliance

3. System processes agent response
   → Validates implementation quality
   → Provides integration guidance
   → Maintains 5-8x performance gains
```

## 📋 **When Agents Are Recommended**

The system automatically recommends your OR-Tools Model Expert for:

### **Phase 2 Constraints (Always Recommended)**
- `skill_matching` → Advanced operator assignment logic
- `operator_availability` → Complex shift and calendar constraints  
- `multi_operator_coordination` → Resource sharing optimization
- `proficiency_optimization` → Performance-based assignment

### **Performance-Critical Constraints**
- `*_optimization` → Requires CP-SAT solver expertise
- `*_performance` → Needs template-aware implementation
- `*_efficiency` → Benefits from variable formulation expertise
- `template_*` → Requires understanding of 5-8x optimization patterns

### **Advanced Constraints (Phase 3)**
- `multi_objective_*` → Complex constraint formulation
- `pareto_*` → Advanced optimization techniques
- `deadline_*` → Sophisticated penalty functions

## 🔧 **Practical Example**
