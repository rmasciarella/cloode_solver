# /solver-status - Check OR-Tools Solver Implementation Status

Provides detailed status of the Fresh OR-Tools solver implementation, showing what's completed, in progress, and planned for each development phase.

## Pattern Matching
- Direct: `/solver-status`
- Natural: "what's implemented?", "show solver progress", "which constraints are done?", "implementation status"

## Implementation

1. Read key solver files to check implementation
2. Scan constraint functions in constraints/ directory
3. Check test coverage and performance metrics
4. Summarize by phase

## Output Template

```
## OR-Tools Solver Implementation Status

### Phase 1 Implementation (Current)

✅ **Completed Components:**
- Core solver class (`FreshSolver`)
- Data models with validation:
  - `Job`, `Task`, `Machine` dataclasses
  - Time conversion to 15-minute intervals
- Basic constraint functions:
  - `add_timing_constraints()` - Task duration enforcement
  - `add_precedence_constraints()` - Task ordering
  - `add_assignment_constraints()` - Machine allocation
- Supabase integration for data loading
- Test framework setup

🔄 **In Progress:**
- Performance optimization
- Search strategies
- Solution quality metrics
- Redundant constraints

❌ **Not Started:**
- Phase 2 constraints (resource capacity)
- Phase 3 constraints (shifts, skills)

### Variable Implementation Status:
- `task_starts[(job_id, task_id)]` - ✅ Implemented
- `task_ends[(job_id, task_id)]` - ✅ Implemented  
- `task_assigned[(job_id, task_id, machine_id)]` - ✅ Implemented
- `task_intervals[(job_id, task_id)]` - 🔄 Partial
- `resource_usage` - ❌ Phase 2
- `worker_assigned` - ❌ Phase 3

### Test Coverage:
- Unit tests: 85% coverage
- Integration tests: Phase 1 complete
- Performance benchmarks: 
  - Tiny (2 jobs): ✅ <1s
  - Small (5 jobs): ✅ <10s
  - Medium (20 jobs): ✅ <60s

### Compliance with Standards:
- ✅ All constraint functions ≤30 lines
- ✅ Proper naming conventions
- ✅ Type hints on all functions
- ✅ Comprehensive docstrings

### Next Steps:
1. Complete search strategy optimization
2. Add redundant constraints for performance
3. Begin Phase 2 planning (resource capacity)
