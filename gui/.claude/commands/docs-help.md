## Available Documentation Commands

Load specific documentation on-demand to manage context efficiently:

**Core Development:**
- `/standards` - Coding standards and type safety requirements
- `/templates` - Code generation templates and type aliases
- `/development` - Architecture details and optimized mode patterns

**Workflows & Processes:**
- `/workflows` - Step-by-step development processes
- `/debug-help` - Troubleshooting and performance debugging
- `/context` - Domain knowledge and business rules

**Usage Tips:**
- Start sessions with minimal context
- Load specific docs only when needed
- Use targeted commands instead of loading everything at once

This reduces initial context consumption by ~70-80% while keeping all documentation accessible.
