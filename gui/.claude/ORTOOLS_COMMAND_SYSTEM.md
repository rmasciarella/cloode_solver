# OR-Tools Solver Custom Command System

## Overview

This document summarizes the custom command system implemented for the Fresh OR-Tools Solver project, enabling Claude to provide specialized assistance for constraint programming development.

## System Architecture

### 1. Command Files Location
```
.claude/
├── commands/
│   ├── ortools/          # OR-Tools specific commands
│   │   ├── project-structure.md

├── COMMAND_REFERENCE.md  # Command syntax reference
├── COMMAND_EXAMPLES.md   # Usage examples
├── CLAUDE_COMMAND_GUIDE.md # Claude's integration guide
└── USER_QUICK_START.md   # User documentation
```

### 2. Command Categories

#### OR-Tools Specific Commands
- `/project-structure` - Analyze solver project organization
- `/solver-status` - Check implementation progress by phase
- `/constraint-patterns` - Show constraint function templates
- `/performance` - Analyze solver performance metrics

#### Development Commands
- `/test` - Run OR-Tools solver test suite
- `/check-standards` - Verify adherence to constraint coding standards

### 3. Integration Points

#### With Project Standards
Commands automatically reference:
- `STANDARDS.md` - 30-line constraint rule, naming conventions
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific instructions
- Phase implementation plans

#### With OR-Tools Patterns
Commands understand:
- CP-SAT model structure
- Decision variable naming (task_starts, task_ends, etc.)
- Constraint function patterns
- Performance optimization techniques

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Natural Language Recognition
Claude recognizes both explicit commands and natural language:
- `/solver-status` OR "what's implemented so far?"
- `/test` OR "run the tests"
- `/constraint-patterns` OR "show me how to add constraints"

### 2. Context-Aware Responses
Commands provide OR-Tools specific guidance:
```python
# When showing constraint patterns:
def add_<type>_constraints(
    model: cp_model.CpModel,  # OR-Tools specific
    task_starts: Dict[Tuple[int, int], IntVar],  # Project convention
    ...
) -> None:
    """Docstring listing constraints added."""
    # Max 30 lines (project standard)
```

### 3. Phased Development Support
Commands understand the three-phase approach:
- Phase 1: Basic scheduling (current)
- Phase 2: Resource capacity
- Phase 3: Advanced features

## Usage Workflow

### For New Developers
1. `/project-structure` - Understand the codebase
2. `/solver-status` - See what's implemented
3. `/constraint-patterns` - Learn the patterns
4. Start coding with Claude's guidance

### For Adding Constraints
1. `/constraint-patterns` - Get the template
2. Implement following standards
3. `/check-standards` - Verify compliance
4. `/test` - Run tests
5. `/performance` - Check impact

### For Debugging
1. `/solver-status` - Current state
2. `/test` - Identify failures
3. `/performance` - Find bottlenecks
4. Get specific help from Claude

## Benefits

### 1. Consistency
- All constraint functions follow the same pattern
- Standards are automatically enforced
- Naming conventions are maintained

### 2. Efficiency
- Quick access to templates and examples
- Automated compliance checking
- Performance tracking built-in

### 3. Learning
- New developers quickly understand patterns
- Best practices are embedded in commands
- OR-Tools specifics are highlighted

## Command Design Principles

### 1. Project-Specific
Commands are tailored for OR-Tools CP-SAT development, not generic programming.

### 2. Action-Oriented
Each command performs a specific development task or provides actionable information.

### 3. Standards-Enforcing
Commands guide users toward compliant implementations automatically.

### 4. Phase-Aware
Commands understand the current development phase and provide appropriate guidance.

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Commands
- `/add-constraint <type>` - Scaffold new constraint functions
- `/optimize-model` - Suggest performance improvements
- `/phase-status <n>` - Detailed status for specific phase
- `/debug-infeasible` - Help debug infeasible models

### Integration Improvements
- Auto-detect current phase from code
- Suggest next implementation steps
- Performance regression tracking
- Constraint conflict detection

## Conclusion

This custom command system transforms Claude into an OR-Tools development specialist, providing:
- Immediate access to project-specific patterns
- Enforcement of coding standards
- Performance-aware development guidance
- Seamless integration with the three-phase approach

The system ensures consistent, high-quality constraint programming implementations while accelerating development through intelligent assistance.
