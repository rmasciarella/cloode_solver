# Final GUI Inspection Report
*Generated: August 1, 2025*

## 🔍 Executive Summary

The Next.js GUI for the Fresh Solver constraint programming application has been comprehensively analyzed. The application provides a complete interface for managing scheduling optimization data with 13 distinct form modules.

## 📊 Architecture Overview

**Framework**: Next.js 15.4.5 with TypeScript
**UI Library**: Tailwind CSS + Radix UI components
**State Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
**Database**: Supabase integration
**Backend**: OR-Tools CP-SAT constraint programming solver

## 🏗️ Component Analysis

### Form Modules Implemented (13 total):
1. **BusinessCalendarForm** - Calendar and scheduling rules
