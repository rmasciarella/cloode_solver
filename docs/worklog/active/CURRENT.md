# Active Development Context - 2025-08-01

## üéØ CURRENT FOCUS (Last Updated: 19:20)
**Primary Task**: Netlify Deployment Runtime Error Resolution
**Status**: Fixed multiple issues but still seeing AuthProvider errors
**Immediate Goal**: Resolve persistent "useAuth must be used within AuthProvider" error

## üö® KNOWN ISSUES

### Critical Blockers
1. **AuthProvider Context Error**
   - Error: "useAuth must be used within AuthProvider"
   - Persists even after fixing all import paths
   - Fixed: Supabase lazy initialization (proxy pattern)
   - Fixed: AuthProvider hierarchy (NavigationHeader now inside providers)
   - Fixed: All imports now use @/lib/auth/context
   - Issue: Error still occurs, possibly caching or build issue

### Deployment Issues
1. **Netlify Serverless Compatibility**
   - Successfully restructured from gui/gui/ to frontend/
   - Fixed Node.js version (18 ‚Üí 22)
   - Fixed dependency placement (@tanstack/react-query moved to dependencies)
   - Supabase environment variables ARE configured in Netlify

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK

### Serverless Fixes Implemented
- Created `service-factory.ts` for lazy service initialization
- Fixed Supabase clients with `supabase-client.ts` lazy loading
- Implemented proxy pattern in `/frontend/lib/supabase.ts` for lazy initialization
- Fixed AuthProvider hierarchy - NavigationHeader now inside providers
- Created AppLayout component for proper component nesting
- Fixed all useAuth imports to use @/lib/auth/context
- Renamed old AuthProvider.tsx to avoid conflicts

### Project Structure
- Moved Next.js app from nested gui/gui/ to clean frontend/ directory
- Updated all build configurations and package.json files
- Fixed Netlify deployment configuration

## üìã TODO LIST

### Immediate Priority
1. **Debug Application Root Errors**
   - Check Netlify function logs for actual error messages
   - Search for remaining module-level Supabase access
   - Look for circular dependencies in imports
   - Check for SSR/client-side code mismatches

2. **Complete Service Migration**
   - Update remaining 12 singleton services:
     * machineService
     * jobTemplateService
     * realtimeManager (check listener cleanup!)
     * departmentService
     * workCellService
     * performanceMonitor
     * navigationRegistry
     * solverIntegration
     * formPerformanceTracker
     * uiRegistry
     * serviceRegistry
     * authAwareSupabase

3. **Verify Fix Effectiveness**
   - Deploy with all lazy initialization complete
   - Monitor for new error patterns
   - Check cold-start performance

### Next Phase
1. **Add Development Safeguards**
   - ESLint rule: no-module-side-effects
   - Pre-commit hook to check for module-level env access
   - Update contribution guidelines

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track cold-start times after lazy initialization
   - Consider memoization for heavy clients
   - Add performance metrics to deployment

## üîß ACTIVE FILES
- `frontend/lib/utils/service-factory.ts` - Lazy initialization utility
- `frontend/lib/supabase-client.ts` - Fixed Supabase client
- `frontend/lib/services/*.service.ts` - Services needing migration
- `frontend/lib/auth.ts` - Partially fixed auth configuration
- `frontend/instrumentation.ts` - Serverless initialization

## ‚ö° QUICK COMMANDS
```bash
# Deploy to Netlify
cd /Users/quanta/projects/fresh_solver
netlify deploy --prod

# Check Netlify logs
netlify logs:function ___netlify-server-handler

# Run local development
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Check for module-level side effects
grep -r "export const.*=.*new\|process\.env" frontend/lib/
```

## üîç SESSION NOTES
- Consensus from 3 AI models: fixes are correct, just need complete implementation
- Application Root errors suggest issue is in React component initialization
- Environment variables ARE set in Netlify, so it's not a missing env var issue
- The lazy initialization pattern is correct but may have introduced timing issues
- Need to check _app.tsx, layout.tsx, and provider components for early Supabase access
